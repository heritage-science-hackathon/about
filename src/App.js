After lunch we will run a couple of workshops which may help you with your project proposals such as website building tools, tips and tricks and how to use sketchfab. In teams you will work on different ways to address issues posed on the Friday evening.  We canâ€™t stress enough at this point, there are no wrong answers! You can design an exhibition, build and app or website, develop a 3D model or plan and education outreach box and curriculum. Think outside the box!",
